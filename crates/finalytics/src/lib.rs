//! Finalytics is a portfolio analytics engine. It keeps the books of a multi-currency portfolio
//! from its transactions, measures performance and risk, and optimises portfolios under real-world
//! constraints.
//!
//! The engine performs no input or output: callers supply instruments, transactions, prices and FX
//! rates, and receive typed results. The same API is available from Python and, through
//! WebAssembly, from JavaScript and TypeScript.

/// The version of this release of Finalytics.
pub const VERSION: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");

/// Returns the version of this release of Finalytics, for example `"1.0.0"`.
